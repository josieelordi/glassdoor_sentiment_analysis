fb arrogant only cares about users insomuch represent -signs within company did n't feel way saw lot empathy towards users lot effort spent improve things fix broken things no direct financial benefit strategy not complex thinking if can make fb easier more fun use then more people use more time each day also network effect attracting even more people use then advertising dollars follow course true fb wants make audience more accessible advertisers well lot people fb care about privacy security   really good infrastructure really great ways share infrastructure code lot cool internal tools 've built really impressive more importantly helps team build products faster without having solve problems someone else already solved every software company tries do fb seems more successful perhaps 's

office open offices multiple companies while do think private office has benefits mostly think 's personal luxury employee huge waste money company 'd much rather money go into other areas like salary benefits other workplace improvements rather than added real estate necessary offices   course 've heard about food snacks amazing selection great stuff like about sort goes above beyond expectations sure days lunch better than others really ca n't complain selection drinks snacks amazing 's not like should work fb just because demonstrates fb 's desire make work fun convenient possible   'll surrounded people like being ca n't think better environment work if giant ego may not like much respect definitely given those deep experience industry expected lead others mentor more junior employees however if whatever reason ca n't perform level expected no one going care if did google shipped ten things ms etc   fb also has lot fun events made lot friends working so going events fun also if 're older worried fb just bunch 22-year olds wo n't fit would n't worry about fb does lot young employees really smart btw does hire lot people straight out college also attracts lot experienced engineers other top companies like google ms amazon etc   work life balance seemed totally normal may different depending team felt could do 40 50 hours work week most part would totally fine 's about produce not hard 're working other team members had children would work normal hours go home normal times did n't see these folks problem left early take care child things like course could times people expected work extra if something critical happens most part everyone wants avoid happens sparingly observed now were times chose work late myself never felt pressure do so caveat call rotations addition even if not call expected reasonably available if call person needs help however again no one wants team work ways avoid these situations   best thing can say working fb about productivity did n't experience political bs pleasure working group people were concerned producing good product making best time spent while doing,fb expects lot out engineers ca n't slack off course should n't slack off job since fb pretty fast paced risk 'll trouble adjusting first   fb has lot custom infrastructure tools prehaps more impressively works great makes doing job really great other hand 'll end up learning lot stuff wo n't applicable elsewhere   fb 's code base very good ways other ways 's not great existing engineers think do n't think big deal important part engineer need
